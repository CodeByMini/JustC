<p> Binary numbers are values represened in a base-2 system.
  There are alot of other ways to represent values like hex, or octal base system
  The most commonly used one that we're all taught and use is the decimal system
  which is in base-10</p>
  
  
  <p> Values represented in bases simply means that we represent values as multiples or powers of that
  base.
  
  The number 100 in decimal(base-10) being 10^2x1 + 10^1x0 + 10^0x0 == 100
  </p>
  <p>
  Where each digit from the right to left is a step up in the power of 10, AND each digit can be
  multiplied by base-1 so for base-10 it's 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. ex: 10^0x6 == 6, 8^1x1 == 8.
  the other numerical system like hexadecimal, octal and binary systems work in exactly the same way.
  The idea being that the bases work as a building block to construct whatever value you're trying to represent.
  </p>
  
  <p> We're mostly going to be using the binary system which is in base-2. Which since it being base-2 only has
  2 possible values per "building block" this makes the binary system really really powerful in computing, because
  it can be used to represent LOGIC, which is why it's used for computing. </p>
